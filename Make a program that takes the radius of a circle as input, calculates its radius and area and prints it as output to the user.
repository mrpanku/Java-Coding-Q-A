Make a program that takes the radius of a circle as input, calculates its radius and area and prints it as output to the user.

class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double radius = 5;
        double area = 3.14*radius*radius;
        System.out.println(area);
        
    }
}
